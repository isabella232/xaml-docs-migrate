# Visual Studio Templates

## Word-Inspired Template

The __Word-Inspired Template__ implements Word-like editing experience represented with the __Telerik UI for WPF__ controls. It provides a complex integration of controls like __RadRibbonWindow__, __RadRibbonView__ and __RadRichTextBox__ in an already set up example. It also demonstrates the broad range of editing and formatting capabilities as well as built in specific features of these controls. In fact the __Word-Inspired Template__ is almost identical to the RadRichTextBox' TelerikEditor example in our __[WPF demos](https://demos.telerik.com/wpf/)__, however it have been visually improved in order to look like the MS Word.

## Excel-Inspired Template

The __Excel-Inspired Template__ implements Excel-like editing experience represented with the __Telerik UI for WPF__ controls. It provides a complex integration of controls like __RadRibbonWindow__, __RadRibbonView__ and __RadSpreadSheet__ in an already set up example. It also demonstrates the broad range of editing and formatting capabilities as well as built in specific features of these controls.

## Outlook-Inspired Template

In this template we joined the powers of some of the most prominent controls in __Telerik UI for WPF__ to create one of the most recognizable applications in the world – Microsoft Outlook. You can easily spot __RadGridView__, __RadRichTextBox__, __RadScheduleView__, __RadDocking__ and __RadCalendar__ how blend seamlessly. The Visual Studio template can be used for a quick start of any other business application. The __Outlook-Inspired Template__ is built from two separate templates available in Visual Studio – __Outlook-Inspired Mail Template__ and __Outlook-Inspired Calendar Template__. They are separated so you can use only the needed functionality in the cases in which you need only the email interface or the calendar one. 

The template is designed with MVVM in mind which is why most of the events that are required in achieving its functionality are passed to the ViewModel via __[EventToCommandBehavior]({%slug common-event-to-command-behavior%})__. There are a few scenarios which are not achievable via __EventToCommandBehavior__ and they are left in the code behind of the MainView. 

Full list of controls used in the __Outlook-Inspired Template__ can be found below:

* EventToCommandBehavior
* RadBusyIndicator
* RadCalendar
* RadContextMenu
* RadDocking
* RadGridView
* RadOutlookBar
* RadRibbonWindow
* RadRibbonButton
* RadRibbonSplitButton
* RadRibbonTab
* RadRibbonComboBox
* RadRichTextBox
* RadRichTextBoxRibbonUI
* RadRichTextBoxStatusBar
* RadRadioButton
* RadScheduleView

You can see how the different parts of the template look like on __Figure 4__ and __Figure 5__.
