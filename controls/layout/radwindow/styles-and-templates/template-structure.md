# Template Structure

Like most {% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}Silverlight{% endif %}{% if site.site_name == 'WPF' %}WPF{% endif %} controls, the __RadWindow__ also allows you to template it in order to change the control from the inside. Except for templating the whole control, you can template only parts of it or even independent controls related to it. This topic will make you familiar with the structure of the __RadWindow__'s template. Here is a snapshot of the template generated in Expression Blend.
