# Hide the Maximize and Minimize buttons

If you want to hide the Minimize and Maximize buttons you have two options:

* [Use the ResizeMode property](#use-the-resizemode-property)

* [Hide the buttons in the RadWindow's ControlTemplate](#hide-the-buttons-in-the-radwindows-controltemplate)

## Use the ResizeMode property

By setting the __ResizeMode__ property to __CanMinimize__ only the __Minimize__ button will be visible. The resize button will get hidden and the resizing will get disabled. By setting the __ResizeMode__ property to __NoResize__ both the Minimize and the Maximize buttons will get hidden, the resizing will also get disabled. 

>If you want to hide these buttons without affecting the resizing functionality, consider using the approach explained below.

To learn more about resizing the __RadWindow__ read [here]({%slug radwindow-features-resizing%}).

## Hide the buttons in the RadWindow's ControlTemplate

Before continuing you have to get familiar with the [RadWindow's template structure]({%slug radwindow-styles-and-templates-template-structure%}) and [how to edit the ControlTemplates]({%slug styling-apperance-editing-control-templates%}).

After getting familiar with the template and preparing it for editing, the only thing left is to locate the __Button__ controls that represent the __Minimize__ and the __Maximize__ buttons and to set their __Visibility__ to __Collapsed__. These buttons have their __Name__ properties set to __PART_MinimizeButton__ and __PART_MaximizeButton__.
