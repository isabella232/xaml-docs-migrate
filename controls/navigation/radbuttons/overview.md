# Key Features

This is a list with short descriptions of the top-of-the-line features of Telerik's __RadButtons__.

* __DropDown Button__: Provides menu-like interface model within a button. It can be very handy for creating more simplistic UI where extensive menus and/or ComboBoxes are not needed. Any kind of content can be placed in the pop-up area displayed upon the activation of the button. Read more about this in the [DropDown Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-dropdown-button%}) article.

* __Split Button__: Extends the __DropDown Button's__ functionality with an action area like in a standard button. The button implements the __IsChecked__ state, too. Read more about this in the [Split Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-split-button%}) article.

* __Toggle Button__: Mimics the functionality of a check box, but has more flexibility in its design. It offers state management based on the check state of the control. Read more about this in the [Toggle Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-toggle-button%}) article.

* __Radio Button__: Mimics the functionality of the radio button, but has more flexibility in its design. Read more about this in the [Radio Button]({%slug radbutton-features-radio-button%}) article.

* __Path Button__: Derives from RadButton, but provides the ability to set a Path alongside its content. Read more about this in the [Path Button]({%slug radbuttons-features-pathbutton%}) article.

* __Command Support__: Full implementation of the Command pattern is available by using RadButtons. You can build complex UIs and keep your code simple by using Commands. Read more about this in the [Commands]({%slug radbuttons-features-commands%}) article.
