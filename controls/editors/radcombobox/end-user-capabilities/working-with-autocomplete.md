# Working with AutoComplete

This topic describes the end-user's workflow for using the __AutoComplete__ feature of the __RadComboBox__.

>In order for the user to be able to use this feature of the __RadComboBox__, its __IsEditable__ property has to be set to __True__.

The first thing to do is to click in the editable part of the __RadComboBox__.

After that begin to type and the first item that matches your input will appear in the editable area. The part that is auto-completed will be selected.

Continue typing and __RadComboBox__ will adjust the value of the mask depending on your input.

After the __RadComboBox__ has set the mask to the desired item, click somewhere in the editable area to remove the selection.
