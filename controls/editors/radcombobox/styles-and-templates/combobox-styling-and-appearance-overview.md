# Overview

This section is intended to give you a broad understanding of the possible ways by which you can change the visual appearance of the __RadComboBox__. There is also comprehensive information about the Control Template and its required parts. You will need this information if you want to customize the appearance of the __RadComboBox__. 

You can modify the look of the __RadComboBox__ either by changing some of the brushes exposed by the API, or by changing the Control Template. In the control template you are allowed to reorder the template parts and your own objects. However, in changing the control template you should be careful to include all required parts.

>Note that in changing the Control Template you should include all required parts. Even thought your code will compile, some of the functionality may be subject to impact due to the omission of the required parts.
