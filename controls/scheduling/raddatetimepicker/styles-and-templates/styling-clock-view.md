# Styling the Clock

To style the clock in your __RadDateTimePicker__ you can do the following:

* Create a __Style__ for it and set it to the __ClockStyle__ property of the __RadDateTimePicker__. To learn how to create a style that targets the __RadCalendar__ control read [here]({%slug raddatetimepicker-styling-raddatetimepicker%}).

* Modify the default resources for the __DateTimePickerClock__, that are generated together with the __RadDateTimePicker's Style__.
